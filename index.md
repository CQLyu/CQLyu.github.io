## Research Interests

**The underlying theme of my research is to understand galaxy evolution through cosmic time, with a particular focus on mass growth history, star formation and quenching, and evolution of metallicity, morphology, structure, and kinematics of galaxies. My works are built on three main tools that help to study galaxy evolution: observations, simulations and machine learning.**

My current research focuses on: 

- Galaxy-Halo Connection

- Chemical Evolution of Galaxies
- Star Formation Quenching of Galaxies

My research interests also include:

- Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligents in Observation
- Contrain Cosmological Parameters in Observation
- Morphology and Physics of Radio Galaxies
