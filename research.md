# Research

**My research delves into the intricate connections among stellar mass growth history, star formation quenching history, halo assembly history, and chemical evolution history. Utilizing sky survey data alongside semi-analytical models and simulations, I aim to uncover the underlying mechanisms shaping the landscape of galaxy formation and evolution.**



## The impact of halo assembly history on galaxy evolution

**In Lyu et al. (2023), we investigate the impact of halo assembly history on galaxy stellar mass growth history and quenching history for central galaxies.** It has been established in previous decades that the growth of galaxy stellar mass is tightly related to the assembly of their host dark matter halos from both observational and theoretical perspectives (Wechsler et al. 2018). However, the secondary effect of the galaxy-halo connections still remains elusive in observation. Using stellar mass growth history derived from SDSS-MaNGA, we show that at a given present-day stellar mass, passive galaxies assembled half of their final stellar mass ∼ 2 Gyr earlier than star-forming counterparts, which agrees well with simulation results. We also look into the state-of-the-art semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, L-GALAXIES, and find that at a given present stellar mass, the passive central galaxies reside in, on average, more massive halos with a higher halo accretion rate across cosmic time. Consequently, passive central galaxies are assembled faster and also quenched earlier than their star-forming counterparts. Different halo assembly history also produces a very different final stellar mass of the central galaxy within, and the difference in the present stellar mass can be as large as ∼ 1 dex. At the same present halo mass, halos assembled earlier tend to host more massive centrals with a higher averaged quenched fraction, in particular around 10 12 M ⊙ . **Our study presents the quantitative connection between the growth of galaxy stellar mass and the assembly of their halo, and calls attention back to the dark matter halo as an important driver of galaxy evolution.**





## Tracing galaxy evolution by metallicity

In Lyu et al. (2023), we investigate the stellar mass growth history and the chemical enrichment history of central galaxies measured from the SDSS-MaNGA survey. We find that at a given epoch, the derived stellar metallicity of central passive galaxies is always higher than that of the star-forming ones. This stellar metallicity enhancement becomes larger for low-mass galaxies (at a given epoch) and for an earlier epoch (at a given stellar mass). **We find strangulation is the primary mechanism for star formation quenching in central galaxies not only in the local Universe (Peng et al. 2015), but very likely also at higher redshifts up to z ∼ 3.**
