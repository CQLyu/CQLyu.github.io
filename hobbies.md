# Hobbies

## City Travelling 



I enjoy traveling in big and small cities, with friends or by myself, visiting local places of interest, especially universities and museums, tasting local delicious food, and experiencing local life. So far, I have visited more than 90 cities in China.

## Chinese Kungfu

I am a fan of Chinese kung fu. Martial arts let me have a higher spiritual temperament, let me calm down and think about the relationship between man and nature. Chinese kung fu is one of the traditional Chinese culture. Among all kinds of cold weapons, I like long staff (长棍), sword (剑), saber (刀), and nunchakus (双节棍).

## Sports

I am buried in a variety of sports, running makes time pass more slowly, cycling makes the wind touch me closely, basketball makes me enjoy the feeling of staying in the air, badminton makes me enjoy the fun of spinning, mountain climbing makes me pursue upward ... Welcome to make friends with me on the sports field!
